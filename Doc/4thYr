1. Introduction:
DataCleaner Application 
This application clean the data of device like
All type of SMS (Inbox, Outbox, Draft)

Browser History
Selected folder of sdcard 

This app act as restore the device.


2. Objective, Scope of Study/Research:

Scope of Study/Research:
How to delete the browser history from the database directly through File system instead of content resolver.
On some devices content resolver fail to delete the history through resolver. 
But if we can access the device storage where this history is maintained and can wipe out that data. Then browser history can be done on all device.

3. Why the Particular Topic or problem is Chosen:
This topic short out a big problem and good for leaning & R&D.

Problem Short-Out:
Due to less memory device hangs, and we need to wipe out the data.
So to wipe out the data with a single click there is no facility. But this app can do.

Learning:
1. Content Resolver
2. Dealing with the memory.

R&D:
How to delete the browser history from the database directly through File system instead of content resolver.

Best for R&D: How to delete the browser history from the database directly through File system instead of content resolver.
4. What contribution would it make?
This is short form of restoring the device.
After the operations performed, device will be available with lot of memory space and speed will be high.
